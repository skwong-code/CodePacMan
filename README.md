# <h1>The Pac-Man Project 

This project is for learning more about HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
The ultimate goal is to make Pac-Man feel more like the classic 80's video arcade game.

Pac-man is a maze arcade game developed and release by the Japanese Developer Namco in 1980. The original name was called Puck Man and was later changed to Pac-Man for World Wide release. 

The game consists of a maze filled with pellets in which the object of the game is to consume all the pellets on the board. The game also have Ghost charters where if a Ghost catches Pac-Man, you lose a life. However, if Pac-Man, consumes a larger glowing pellet called a Power Pellet, then the tables are turned as the Ghost instead of running towards Pac-Man will run away and if Pac-man in its super power state catches up to a ghost will then in turn consume the Ghost.

Scoring is based on Pac-Man consuming pellets, Ghosts (in his super powered state) and fruit that will randomly generate and move around the maze. There is no time limit and a new maze will be generated if all the pellets are consumed. Game ends when Pac-Man lives run out.

This epic more than likely will be divided into smaller User Stories, to hammer out specific areas of the game. Such as Graphics, Control Movements. Ghost Movements and Game Maze Environments and scoring.
